The title’s “landscape” is a large multi-variable space where sets of morals create peaks and valleys of human wellbeing (the dependent variable). He argues that science will one day identify a metric for wellbeing, and that we will be able to use science to tune our morals, and that other methods of moral-selection will be irrational.<br/><br/>To believe Harris’ theory, you have to be on board with two ideas. First, some sets of morals are better for humans than others, and, second, the human experience is an absolutely physical phenomena and, therefore, understandable by scientific means (not currently, but at some point).<br/><br/>Oddly I did not enjoy the book <i>because</i> I agreed with Harris. I agree that human wellbeing is theoretically quantifiable. And I agree that sets of behaviors will be known to improve the collective human experience (perhaps by brain scan) and that societies should continually move towards those goals. But Harris dwelled on those that don’t agree with him.<br/><br/>Harris’ foils are on both the left and right. On the left, he sees moral relativists. He sees anthropologists encountering extreme sacrificial violence and proclaiming that it’s not their place to judge. On the right, Harris sees religious ignorance. People living (or claiming to live) by sets of codes from ancient texts that were passed by word of mouth for generations and then poorly translated and selectively applied.<br/><br/>For example, in one of the most oddly and vivid sections, Harris rails against NIH-director Francis Collins. This was his lead-in to a discussion of Collins’ book:<br/><blockquote>The Language of God is a genuinely astonishing book. To read it is to witness nothing less than an intellectual suicide. Is it, however, a suicide that has gone almost entirely unacknowledged: The body yielded to the rope; the neck snapped; the breath subsided; and the corpse dangles in ghastly discomposure even now—and yet polite people everywhere continue to celebrate the man’s health.</blockquote><br/><br/>I am an atheist that studied and did research in biology. I do not like reading that the director of the NIH decided on the existence of God because of a beautiful hike. I do not like being reminded that only 15 percent of Americans believe <i>Homo sapiens</i> 1. evolved and 2. did so without God’s guidance. When I read things like that, I get anxious. I wonder: what the fuck is wrong with people? Why do so many people believe in fairy tales? Then I wonder if I’m being elitist. Then I decide I’m not elitist, it’s the education system that’s messed up. Then I wonder whether that’s just another form of elitism. I stop the train of thought deciding that people aren’t actually religious, and don’t actually believe those religious things, they just pretend to fit in with others who are also pretending.<br/><br/>Anyway, the book’s central idea is interesting but not fleshed out in the way I had hoped. Rather than imagining the experiments and observations that would be necessary to find moral correlates of an improved human experience, Harris attacks the non-believers.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

45269616,Meditations,Marcus Aurelius,"Aurelius, Marcus",Meric Casaubon,"=""""","=""""",3,4.22,AmazonClassics,Kindle Edition,221,2019,180,2020/06/16,2020/06/16,,,read,"In Nassim Taleb’s <em>Antifragile</em> he recounted a story of the death of Seneca. A Stoic philosopher from first-century Rome, Seneca was sentenced to death by suicide for an assassination plot he had nothing to do with. But when told of his fate, Seneca accepted and executed it with absolute calmness. I wanted to learn more about the philosophy of someone with that level of self-possession.<br/><br/>If you Google books on Stoicism, <em>Meditations</em> will show up on every list. It is the collection of self journaled reflections from Marcus Aeralius, a roman emperor for 20 years. Experts believe that he wrote <em>Meditations </em>during breaks from war-strategizing against Germanic tribes to the North and the Parthian Empire to the East. Supposedly, the writings were never meant to be publicized but were after his death.<br/><br/><em>Meditations</em> is broken into separate “books,” each of which was written during a different period of Aeralius’ life. The contents of each book varies widely, but the thread throughout is Aeralius pondering how and what it means to live a “good” and rational life. Despite its winding, translated language, the morals of <em>Meditations</em> are clear: a rational life is better than an emotional one, desire for praise and status is harmful, and it's good to be kind and accepting towards others. In some ways, it had the same austerity of Christianity but without the allusions to an afterlife and specific religious figures. For example, “Those things which in this life are dearest unto us, and of most account, they are in themselves but vain, putrid, contemptible.”<br/><br/>A lot of Aeralius’ recommendations would fit neatly into modern pop-psychology. For example, this section could have been lifted from a book on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy like <em>Mind Over Mood</em>:<br/><blockquote>If therefore it be a thing external that causes thy grief, know, that it is not that properly that doth cause it, but thine own conceit and opinion concerning the thing: which thou mayest rid thyself of, when thou wilt.</blockquote><br/><br/>And this section sums up the entirety of a recent book on intrinsic motivation, <em>Drive</em>:<br/><br/><blockquote>The ambitious supposeth another man’s act, praise and applause, to be his own happiness; the voluptuous his own sense and feeling; but he that is wise, his own action.</blockquote><br/><br/>But the most common motif of the book was consideration for the finiteness and limits of a single life. Despite him being the most powerful person in the world at the time of the book’s writing, Aeralius was obsessed with how little he mattered when considering that everyone he knows will soon be dead, too:<br/><br/><blockquote>For as for praise, consider how many who once were much commended, are now already quite forgotten, yea they that commended them, how even they themselves are long since dead and gone.</blockquote><br/><br/>Reading sections like the one above (there are maybe 50 sections like it), I frequently thought of a recent book: <em>How to Change your Mind</em>. It’s Michael Pollan’s book on psychedelics and research into their positive effects on mental health. He concluded the book with research suggesting that psychedelics suppress our brain’s default mode network. In Pollan’s telling, the default mode network acts like the traffic-cop ego of our brain, and psychedelics free us, greatly in the short-term and minorly in the long-term, from that obsessive tyrant. If Pollan is right, that the default mode network acts like our ego and is devoted to understanding our place in the world, Aeralius’ self-rumination on death and the insignificance of his own life may have been a way to check his own ego in a way that improved his day-to-day mood.<br/><br/>Though Aeuralius espouses the good and rational life, his specific suggestions were vague. He often fell back on tautology: “A happy lot and portion is, good inclinations of the soul, good desires, good actions.” He wrote eloquently about the impermanence of a single life but then trailed off without advice for how one should live given that awareness of one's own mortality (which is part of why I think Aeuralius ruminated on death more for mood-regulation than anything else). In the bits where he did try to get specific, he advocates socialization and representation of one's community in a way that reflected his position with ancient Rome (his environmental upbringing):<br/><br/><blockquote>My city and country as I am Antoninus, is Rome; as a man, the whole world. Those things therefore that are expedient and profitable to those cities, are the only things that are good and expedient for me.</blockquote><br/><br/>Finally, there was an underlying hypocrisy that kept coming to mind: Aeralius’ never mentions slaves. He devotes so much thought to the importance of being kind and patient with his fellow citizens, but never worries about the 30% of Romans that were enslaved. In one bit he expresses awareness for the gap between celebrity and goodness: “For it is a thing very possible, that a man should be a very divine man, and yet be altogether unknown.” But he doesn’t bring up slaves. In another bit he laments his lifestyle: “Toys and fooleries at home, wars abroad: sometimes terror, sometimes torpor, or stupid sloth: this is thy daily slavery.” But he doesn’t mention slaves who lived in <em>actual</em> slavery.<br/><br/>It would be easy to point out that this was 160AD, and it’s not fair to expect Aeralius to have been enlightened. But I think that it reflects on <em>who</em> Aeralius had in mind when writing advice for the good-life: the upper-upper class of Rome. When he writes “So live as indifferent to the world and all worldly objects, as one who liveth by himself alone upon some desert hill,” he writes that as someone who had food and entertainment brought to him upon request. In a modern context, white, wealthy, California tech-executives discovering eastern spirituality and departing on 2-week silent retreats is a trope. It sounds impressive, but it isn’t when you realize they have the wealth and safety net to do whatever they want, and all their basic human needs will still be met.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
16131932,The Emperor's Soul,Brandon Sanderson,"Sanderson, Brandon",,"=""""","=""""",4,4.32,Dragonsteel Entertainment,Kindle Edition,144,2012,2012,2020/05/15,2020/05/14,,,read,"<i>The Emperor’s Soul</i> is a novella by Brandon Sanderson about a world in which a “Forger” has to recreate the soul of an assassinated emperor. Alive but brain-dead, the senile emperor is a threat to the political positions of his advisors.<br/><br/>The protagonist, Shai, is adept at forgery: the magical ability to alter objects like paintings, furniture, and clothing. She’s so proficient that she can alter the souls of humans. The story is about Shai recreating the emperor’s soul to restore him to his pre-assassination-state.<br/><br/>Like <i>Elantris</i>, <i>The Emperor’s Soul</i> has a compelling, grounded magic system. By altering a person or object's past, Shai can change the physical properties of the object in the present. It’s like she can reroute the river(s) of time, adding and subtracting flows, influencing nature and nurterment. In an introductory example, Shai rewrites the history of an abused table so it assumes the state of one that had been maintained.<br/><br/>The heady parts of <i>The Emperor’s Soul</i> are those where you wonder about the origin of the common objects around us — there’s a not-subtle nod to Shintoism’s respect for the “spirits” that inhabit physical things. Each object, like people, has a rich backstory. Shai’s mastery comes from her deep knowledge of objects’ sources, like the veins of rock from which bricks were mined. <br/><br/>There is an interesting tension between Shai and the other characters. She understands people and objects, both logically and spiritually, while the political advisers do not:<br/><br/><blockquote>The arbiters had no idea what they were asking. But of course they didn’t. They hated Forgery, or so they claimed. They walked on imitation floor tiles past copies of ancient vases, they let their surgeons repair a body, but they didn’t call any of these things “Forgery” in their own tongue.</blockquote><br/><br/>A real-world parallel might be our ignorance of manufacturing. We order an iPhone from the Apple store, use it daily, and imagine it was carved from a magical rock by Steve Jobs’ ghost. But it was mined, smelted, hammered, and assembled in Zhengzhou, China.<br/><br/>My issue with <i>The Emperor’s Soul</i> is the same as my issue with Sanderson’s other book, <i>Elantris</i>: the characters are too perfect. Shai is a mega-genius that can read any situation and is always three steps ahead of everyone else. Reading <i>The Emperor’s Soul</i> is equivalent to reading about superwoman in a knife fight. There was never a doubt that Shai was going to 1. succeed in restoring the Emperor and then 2. forge her way out of danger.<br/><br/>I still liked the world of <i>The Emperor’s Soul</i> though. His magic systems are surprisingly plausible, which Sanderson, in the epilogue, attributes to his grounding them in a scientific veneer.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Statisticians, philosophers, doctors, and psychologists; to Taleb, they’re hacks focused on tenure and income. What does he like? Weightlifting, the word “convex,” and talking about himself. He also likes warning readers that technical sections are coming—a lie used to preempt criticism.<br/><br/>Taleb starts the book by defining that new word, “antifragility”: something which gains from external shocks and disorder. He compares it to the word “blue,” a thing that long lacked a label. Biological species, wine, and Switzerland meet Taleb’s definition of antifragile.<br/><br/>In his major example of antifragility, Taleb describes two brothers. One is a weak, salary-bound banker who works at the same job for decades. The other is a cab driver who works day-to-day, and never knows how much he’ll make. According to Taleb, the cab driver is antifragile and the banker fragile. If the banker loses his job, he has nothing to fall back on; it’s all he knows. Conversely, the cab driver is in charge of his own destiny. If business is slow, he can change where and when he drives.<br/><br/>You, a critical thinker, might wonder “what the fuck is Taleb talking about?” Taleb’s home, New York City, was just fined $850 million for using bankers to finance auctions of over-priced medallions to taxi drivers. The story would have been more realistic if a thousand bankers each gave their cab-driving brother a one million dollar high-interest loan for a depreciating asset. The bankers would have been antifragile and the drivers fragile.<br/><br/>But the book continues this way. Or “books,” rather (there are several “books” inside what looks conspicuously like a single book). Taleb presents an activity, idea, or person and calls it fragile or antifragile. He sprinkles in mythology and personal anecdotes enough so it's clear that this book is actually a meandering collection of things that Taleb found interesting. There’s no instance where the antifragility of Taleb’s subject changes the way a reader sees or thinks about that thing.<br/><br/><i>Antifragile</i> requires a ton of patience. I saw “former quantitative trader and risk analyst” and thought I was in for some dense and technical analysis of how humans underappreciate risk. But that stuff must have been in Taleb’s earlier book: <i>Black Swan</i>. Instead, I had to read about how Taleb lifts weights, how Taleb orders dinner, how Taleb writes, how Taleb reads, how Taleb handles copyeditors, how Taleb gives speeches, and how a former female friend of Taleb was actually a gold-digger that Taleb was lucky to avoid dating because clearly she was actually obsessed with money and thank God Taleb didn’t date or marry her.<br/><br/>The book’s function is to remind us that humans are fallible. Consumers are economically irrational. Modern medicine is great, but overdiagnosis can do more harm than good. Practice precedes theory in engineering, and academics take and receive too much praise for industry innovations. The book’s contents should be news to no one.<br/><br/>So why was the book so positively reviewed? Because it was published in 2012. With the US economy still recovering from the financial crisis, business journalists were enamored with Taleb’s prior, prophetic <i>Black Swan</i> (2007). He had foreseen humans' inability to price in extreme events. He was the boy shouting “the emperor wears no clothes,” and that success went straight to Taleb’s head. In several sections, Taleb describes his distaste for editors. But he needed one. Because <i>Antifragile</i> is overindulgent and borderline useless.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

In the shadow of a once powerful city, Elantris, the characters vie for control of a smaller city called Kae.<br/><br/>The story tracked three characters. The first was Raoden, a prince afflicted by a disease that left him disfigured and without a pulse. He was quarantined in Elantris with others in a similar zombie-like state. The second was the prince’s should-have-been wife, Sarene. She was plotting and scheming in Kae to prevent it from falling to the Fjorell invaders. Finally, there was Hrathen. Something like an ambassador, soldier, and cardinal mixed into one, he represented the Fjorell invaders. Hrathen’s storyline was by far the most interesting of the three and it was not close.<br/><br/>Raoden and Sarene were the same at the book’s end as they were at its start: flat, repetitious, boring. Raoden was a white knight thrown into a bad situation. Sarene was a strong, independent woman longing for human connection. Both were repeatedly getting the better of those around them – winning their political battles and proving themselves virtue-signaling “good guys.” Neither did nor said anything outside their narrow set of pre-defined views and goals.<br/><br/>Hrathen, by contrast, evolved in unexpected and interesting ways. He, too, dominated the lesser characters that surrounded him… until he did not. He was a devout follower of the Fjorell religion… until he was not. The Hrathen of one chapter would adapt and shift by the next – it was impossible to predict whether he would be self-assured or insecure, deflated or scheming. In the novel’s most interesting portions, Hrathen questioned his own faith and doubted  his reasons for joining the Fjorell religion in the first place. He contrasted his own logical, clinically religious devotion with the blind passion of younger members, feeling himself inadequate. Unfortunately, besides Hrathen, the characters of <i>Elantris</i> were consistently rigid.<br/><br/>Besides the characters, <i>Elantris</i> is definable by its Sanderson-esque “magic system”: an alternate, internally consistent set of physics. In this novel it was the “Dor”: an omnipotent energy potential that Elantrians could direct toward their targets via “Aons”: signs painted in the air. The shapes of an Aon determined itseffect and each was extensible via modifiers. <br/><br/>But despite their description and buildup, Aons were largely irrelevant until the final pages. Their reveal was telegraphed and discussed for well over half the novel – each chapter I hoped was the one that would finally feature Aon-usage – but they were withheld until the book couldn’t progress (to a positive ending) without them. It was as if Harry Potter had been taught about the <i>idea</i> of magic for seven books and then suddenly used it for the first time in his duel against Voldemort. In <i>Elantris</i>, I would have preferred either much more of the magic or its total removal with a concomitant darker ending.<br/><br/>Given Sanderson’s fame, I was disappointed by the boring, unidimensional characters of <i>Elantris</i>. That plus the dearth of magic left little for the book to stand on. Because I trust Sanderon’s recommenders and want to understand the hype, I am going to give him another try with <i>Mistborn</i>.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Atul Gawande gets 5 stars because he is, in large part, why I dropped the idea of medical school. Iain Banks gets 5 stars because he gave me hope in a humanity enabled by technology. Pollan’s “How to Change Your Mind” was an enjoyable read but it’s just a 4 for me.<br/><br/>Pollan’s strength is in transcribing experiences and sensations that he and every psychonaut acknowledge as being ineffable. His background writing about food is an ideal qualification for psychedelics: both are deeply subjective and indescribable. I’ve tried some of the hallucinogens Pollan describes and found his descriptions convincing and consistent with my memories. And I felt that I at least understood the significance of his DMT and ayahuasca trips, though I’ve tried neither.<br/><br/>Also and importantly for a book on the subject, Pollan maintains skepticism. My guess is that conservative critics will think he’s a doped-up cheerleader for psychedelics because of the mysticism permeating his and other participants’ trips. But Pollan continually wonders whether the drugs confer real insight or simple hypoxic side-effects — he repeatedly poses the question to experts. And rather than going full shaman, Pollan embraces a totally material perspective near the book’s end in Chapter Five: The Neuroscience. He summarizes recent literature exploring the “default mode network” (DMN) and the “5-HT receptor.” By the book’s close, Pollan constructs a perspective of psychedelics’ effects as being a mishmash of awe and suppression of the DMN without giving up his initial science-based, materialistic worldview. He avoids going full cheerleader.<br/><br/>This book remains a 4 for me, right now, because it’s too late to have changed my life. Around 5 years ago I heard a RadioLab episode — Blisshrooms — describing the same seminal research that Pollan covers with theology students in BU’s Marsh Chapel, smokers, and terminal cancer patients. It was the “set” with which I dove into mushrooms. Unfortunately for psychonauts and Pollan, there aren’t many new research results of those studies’ level for Pollan to reveal in “How to Change Your Mind.” So while Pollan does an honorable job introducing all the players — the scientists and underground therapists — page after page I felt like Pollan was re-telling popular news. Psychedelics went mainstream, a second time, before Pollan’s book, so it’s just a bit too late to have changed my life/mind.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I started and finished it while in Paris during the yellow-vest protests. For those few short days I passed the remains of violent protest—burnt cars, smashed windows, and graffitied ATMs—and in the background I read Rushkoff argue that modern capitalism destroyed society by devaluing workers’ sense of worth and hoarding capital within monopolistic firms. The setting was ideal. The book made me view venture-capital-funded tech startups as something like ponzi schemes and convinced me that the rate of money changing hands is synonymous with money’s utility. In the backdrop of inequality-fueled protests, Rushkoff convinced me that modern capitalism, defined by stock buybacks and corporate “war chests,” is bloated and inefficient and the root cause of political turmoil in developed countries today.<br/><br/>I went into <i>Team Human</i> expecting a similar level of <i>insight</i>. I wanted Rushkoff to explain the 2020 election’s malaise as the byproduct of corporate control and indoctrination. I wanted a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxp-u9hjHaQ"">Galloway-esque polemic</a > about Facebook’s spreading of disinformation. Instead, I read through 200 pages of half-baked <a href=""https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hidea"">hideas</a>. Section after section—100 of them—Rushkoff punched at the issues that he thinks plague society: isolationism, scientific elitism, time as a linear concept (seriously). And section after section, he failed to follow through. For each issue he'd present a problem plaguing modern life, give a half-paragraph explanation of its history, then wander off into vagaries that left me wondering when he was going to get back to the point.<br/><br/>The gist of <i>Team Human</i> is that technologies are crudely replacing the things that most make us human. Social media is replacing socialization; science is replacing morality; video games are replacing challenge and reward. While Rushkoff paints a bleak picture of modern life, he concludes the book by asking humanists to unite like the participants of Occupy Wallstreet and Burning Man. I’m drawn to the subject matter. It’s why I bought the book. Give me a few citations and polemicize away. <i>Team Human</i>’s issue isn’t its subject however, but its complete lack of substantiation.<br/><br/>An example is Section 78; in it, Rushkoff begins by highlighting the scientific community’s lack of trust among the public: “Our common sense and felt experience contradict too much of what we’re being told by scientific authorities… Research scientists’ willingness to play along with industry and accept grants to prove the benefits of tobacco or corn syrup doesn’t encourage us to place more trust in them either.” Rushkoff questions the relatability to scientists and points out that the general public might conflate the average scientist with industry shills, sowing doubt. But he <i>immediately </i>loses focus: “The unemployed coal worker doesn’t want to be retrained to build solar panels for a company thousands of miles away, owned by venture capitalists aligned with progressives screaming about climate change.” While you’d expect Rushkoff to explain what <i>caused</i> this coal-miner’s disbelief in climate change, and further the subject he started the section with, it never happens. Instead we’re left with this self-indulgent, recursive metaphor:<br/><blockquote>There is no backdrop against which reality happens. An object doesn’t sit anywhere absolute in space; its position is entirely a matter of its relation to every other object out there… Like a dancer where the only space that exists is defined by and between the dancers themselves, everything is happening in relationship to everything else. It’s never over, it’s never irrelevant, it’s never somewhere else… That’s what forces science into the realm of morality, karma, circularity, and timelessness that prescientific people experienced.</blockquote><br/><br/>Besides intra-section meandering like that of Section 78, Rushkoff makes dozens of baseless and unconvincing arguments. He implies that ADHD medication is overprescribed because of the internet, that transhumanism is an avoidance of personal responsibility, and that science will never provide a mechanistic explanation for consciousness. Each warrant a book or at least a chapter, but none of those claims were explored because they were just fodder for whatever tangent Rushkoff was drifting along on at the time.<br/><br/>The moments that I enjoyed most were Rushkoff’s reflections on how we got to this point. As a software engineer who’s constantly looking at a computer monitor, I was particularly empathetic to his description of the experience that humans felt when, after years of watching the programming sent to them by major network channels, video games and computers enabled hobbyists to manipulate the pixels on their screens. Rather than passively consuming, gamers and programmers were able to create. It's obvious there was a time before and a time after people could change the pixels on their screens, but I’d never thought of what that jump must have felt like, and Rushkoff, a media theorist, was able to impart some of that awe.<br/><br/>The book was aggravating. At best, it’s a high—<i>high</i>—level review of Rushkoff’s prior writing; a quick reminder that technology does not a utopia make. At its worst, it’s a hodgepodge of nonsequiturs, rambles, and questionable opinions.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
44578234,Labyrinth of Ice: The Triumphant and Tragic Greely Polar Expedition,Buddy Levy,"Levy, Buddy",,"=""""","=""""",3,4.43,St. Martin's Press,Kindle Edition,400,2019,2019,2019/12/27,2020/01/01,,,read,"Labyrinth of Ice is the story of the 1881 Lady Franklin Bay Expedition. Twenty-five explorers, led by first lieutenant Adolphus Greely, spent years in the most remote parts of northeast Canada and northwest Greenland. <br/><br/>The expedition’s goals were twofold: science and fame. The scientific purpose of the trip was to study the geography, climate, and magnetic fields of the arctic. Things we take for granted now were unknown at the time of the expedition. For example, that Greenland is an island and not a peninsula. To achieve fame, Greely hoped to reach “Furthest North” – the northmost point recorded by an explorer – or the North Pole itself. <br/><br/>Over the first two years, the crew’s greatest struggles were boredom and cabin fever. After reaching northeast Canada, they set up a base, Fort Conger, from which they collected scientific observations. They ventured about with dog sleds to characterize the geography of the surrounding area. Hunters killed bears, seals, and wolves to augment the limited rations that were brought aboard their ship, the Proteus. At such a northern location, the explorers faced the challenge of months of darkness. To bolster morale during those winter months, Greely had everyone exercise, socialize, and study daily. He gave lectures on history and geography to ward off depression among the crew. Christmas and New Year’s were planned celebrations occasioned by baseball games and live performances by the members of the crew.<br/><br/>The story changed dramatically after the first two years of relief ships repeatedly failed to reach Fort Conger. With dwindling supplies, the 25-man crew of Fort Conger abandoned their base and, with only a small steamboat, attempted to travel south enough for retrieval the subsequent year. This left them with eight months to survive an entire arctic winter, outside their fort, with only enough supplies for two months. Scurvy, frostbite, and alcoholism ate away at the crew one by one as they succumbed to the inhospitable environment. <br/><br/>Remarkably, Buddy Levy keeps Labyrinth of Ice centered on the human element of the expedition. Using the crew’s journals as first-hand sources, Levy manages to tell the story without reducing the adventure to one of rote dates and facts. He also puts the expedition in context, making clear the importance of the expedition’s scientific evidence, given that large parts of Greenland’s ice are now melting at an alarming rate. He points out that Greely’s crew’s data is used by climatologists today as a baseline for what the climate used to be.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I found this historical non-fiction dry. When the first year’s relief ship failed its journey North, and when Levy shifted from survival to politics in America, I found myself losing interest. In his adherence to telling the events in an undramatized and truthful manner, Levy lost me in bits where things became monotonous. That said, this book gave me a new interest in exploration that I lacked before. I've recommended it to others.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

32191706,The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America,Richard Rothstein,"Rothstein, Richard",,"=""1631492853""","=""9781631492853""",4,4.46,Liveright,Hardcover,368,2017,2017,,2020/01/25,,,read,"I fit within the group of people Richard Rothstein had in mind when he wrote <i>The Color of Law</i>: I believed that segregation between blacks and whites in the United States was the byproduct of localized racism and economic disparities. I believed that segregation in American was “<i>de facto</i>” – because that’s what I was taught.<br/><br/>I now understand that the government implemented segregation through a combination of laws, policies, and intentional indifference. Segregation in the United States was “<i>de jure</i>,” created and perpetrated by the government – in violation of the 14th amendment and blacks’ rights – for a hundred years. <br/><br/>Rothstein wrote the book in response to a 2007 Supreme Court opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts. In that majority opinion, striking down an attempt to desegregate Detroit public schools, Roberts wrote:<br/><br/><blockquote>The Constitution simply does not allow federal courts to attempt to change that situation unless and until it is shown that the State, or its political subdivisions, have contributed to cause the situation to exist. No record has been made in this case showing that the racial composition of the Detroit school population or that residential patterns within Detroit and in the surrounding areas were in any significant measure caused by governmental activity.</blockquote><br/><br/>It turns out you have to be a liar or ignorant to write what Roberts wrote. In a forgiving manner, Richard Rothstein assumes that Roberts “lacked the facts” and hopes to educate other Americans with <i>The Color of Law</i>. Speaking personally, the book is effective at that. It’s a torrent of facts, figures, illustrations, and testimony that obliterate the idea of <i>de facto</i> segregation. No reader can finish the book and continue to imagine that blacks and whites live in segregated neighborhoods based on preference alone.<br/><br/>The most glaring example of de jure segregation was in the government’s unequal distribution of government-backed loans. In the early 1930s, private loans required 50% down payments with interest-only payments and full repayment within five to seven years. Because private loans put homeownership outside the reach of middle- and lower-class citizens, the Roosevelt administration created the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). It was the FHA that first provided mortgages that covered 80% of the purchasing price of homes and were amortized – homeowners accrued equity while paying them off. But, between the FHA’s inception in 1934 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, only 2% of FHA loans were given to black families. The FHA’s official underwriting manual specified that administrators should avoid providing mortgages to neighborhoods at risk of “infiltration of inharmonious racial or nationality groups.” Not only did the FHA deny blacks access to mortgages, but they denied mortgages to whites who lived in or near black neighborhoods. This put homeownership outside the reach of both blacks and whites within those areas and virtually guaranteed that they would become segregated. <br/><br/>And it wasn’t just the FHA. When the VA adopted the FHA’s guidelines for their loans, they systematically denied black World War II veterans access to mortgages and homeownership (and they generally refused to pay for black veterans’ education if it wasn’t vocational, limiting the income potential of returning veterans).<br/><br/>The reverberations of denial of loans to black families in the 30s and 40s continue today. A San Francisco house sold in the mid-1940s cost about $8,000 ($75,000 today). Today, the same house would sell for $350,000 or more. Home equity is the primary means for wealth accumulation by Americans and blacks were denied access when homes were cheapest (relative to income). As Rothstein says, FHA and VA loans of the 40s and 50s have become permanent. Further – and this is discussed in greater detail in the book – the neighborhoods that were designated as “black” tend to be far from well-paying suburban jobs and instead near low-paying industrial zoned areas. In other words, it was a double punch by the government: blacks were denied access to livable neighborhoods, with appreciation, and were pushed from jobs that could have provided incomes commensurate with the home prices of better neighborhoods.<br/><br/>In addition to racist financing and zoning, the government incited and encouraged violence towards blacks that attempted integration. In one livid example, Rothstein tells the story of Harvey Clark – an Air Force veteran that dared, in 1951, to try and move his family to an apartment in a traditionally white part of Chicago. First, the chief of police told Clark’s real estate agent to “get out” and “don’t come back … or I’ll put a bullet through you.” Days later, a 4,000-person riot ensued outside Clark’s apartment. In front of the police, the crowd ransacked Clark’s apartment, threw his family’s possessions out the windows and burned them in the front yard. While the police watched. No one was arrested. A first-hand account says the police “acted like ushers politely handling the overflow at a football stadium.” Of the rioters, 118 were arrested but zero were indicted by a grand jury. Instead, Harvey Clark, his real estate agent, his NAACP attorney, and the landlord were all arrested and charged with inciting a riot and devaluing property values. This is a single story among dozens in <i>The Color of Law</i>. Bombings, firebombings, cross-burning, and mob violence were supported or tolerated by police throughout America.<br/><br/>This book is incredible for its breadth and information density. I left out mention of whole chapters on topics like unequal property tax assessments, “reverse-redlining” (where blacks were targeted with subprime mortgages), and IRS tax breaks that were given to knowingly racist companies and churches. The book is infuriating but illuminating. As Rothstein argues: through an understanding of government-mandated segregation, things like wealth inequality between whites and blacks, inner-city conditions, and race riots in Ferguson make greater sense. Rothstein wraps the book up brilliantly, proposing concrete policies like improved public transportation and voucher systems which could ameliorate the conditions of segregated neighborhoods and inner-city projects.<br/><br/>My only minor qualm with the book is the dearth of human faces. Rothstein tries weaving in a story of a San Francisco machinist who is pushed from project to project, preventing his family from accessing the education and jobs by which they could move up the socioeconomic ladder. And while I appreciate Rothstein’s attempt to humanize the statistics, the story never fits neatly within the book’s non-chronological approach. Each chapter covers a different integration tactic. Whenever Rothstein mentions the machinist, often at a chapter’s end, it feels forced and confusing – I would have preferred separate chapters devoted to the human element, rather than the present interleaving.<br/><br/>Despite this minor reservation, Rothstein manages to thoroughly document segregation in America as the byproduct of government-implemented violence and financial policy. The consequences are significant. Forty-eight percent of the last two generations of blacks have lived in poor neighborhoods compared to seven percent of whites; one-third of middle- and upper-income black families live in neighborhoods near or alongside low-income areas compared to six percent of white families.<br/><br/>The book’s goal is not to convince but to educate. He cites four of the most used high school textbooks in America and reports that none bear any mention of government-implemented segregation. Each has a sentence or two about <i>de facto</i> segregation – but none mention FHA or VA loans, zoning, government-sanctioned violence, or any of the other methods of <i>de jure</i> segregation. One hopes that Rothstein’s book helps change that.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The series begins with humans encountering a belligerent alien species from a neighboring star system, but the scale of humans’ conflict increases exponentially each each book.<br/><br/>Liu’s universe is always kinetic. Characters’ decisions cascade through hundreds of years of human history and — with hibernation as a plot device — they see the consequences of their decisions in the flesh.<br/><br/>In the third book, the primary such character is Cheng, an aerospace engineer. She’s the technical lead of a government program to shoot a human brain towards the approaching Trisolarian civilization. After firing one off, she hibernates for 300 years to a point in time where humans and the Trisolarian race are in a stand-off. Humans are threatening to alert the universe to their existence through gravitational waves, effectively committing suicide, if the Trisolarian force infiltrates Earth.<br/><br/>Cheng is elected “Swordholder”, chief negotiating officer, but the Trisolarian force deems her weak and immediately attacks Earth. Only through a deus ex machina do humans frighten the Trisolarian fleet away with gravitational waves. In other words, humans choose the devil they don’t know.<br/><br/>Liu so deftly weaves world building with philosophy and cosmology that it is easy to forget that he’s writing fiction. Liu captures primitive urges — survival, improvement, expansion — and constructs from them an organic hologram of our Solar System, Milky Way, and universe. In that universe, humans grapple for meaning and policy amongst external, warring alien civilizations. More than mere fiction, it feels like Liu is predicting with how humanity will adapt and react to interstellar technology.<br/><br/>And I have faith in Liu’s interpretation of humanity at large. Humans cycle between timidity, overoptimism, strength, resignation, enlightenment, and ignorance. Governments oscillate between fascism, libertarianism, and democracy. Innovation is both publicly and privately funded and the characters’ allegiance is divided between their family, government, and species.<br/><br/>On the cosmic scale, Liu questions whether the universe’s natural “forces” are natural at all. He suggests that dimensions and Lightspeed are weapons that God-tier civilizations utilize in their wars with one another. For example, a civilization might transform itself from a 4D to a 3D species before vaporizing their 4D world and their enemies within it. In Liu’s universe, war is the only constant.<br/><br/>The book has spirituality and philosophy that’s unmatched in both prior books. Cheng, in an inter-dimensional time capsule, creates a memoir of humanity that, in a twist, is revealed to be the source material for many of the series’ earlier chapters. And ultimately she risks her life. She and countless like her leave their inter-dimensional time capsules so the universe has enough mass to collapse into a Big Crunch.<br/><br/>So Cheng resolves The Remembrance of Earth’s Past on a note of sacrifice. Life to Liu is a struggle for survival and power, but Liu’s protagonist gives that up for the motherly creation of a new universe she will never meet. In Liu’s universe, life reveals itself as a force that acts across form and time.",true,,1,,,0,,,,,

12968601,The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Sarah Palin,Corey Robin,"Robin, Corey",,"=""""","=""""",3,3.96,,Kindle Edition,305,,2011,2019/10/31,2019/10/29,,,read,"In <i>The Reactionary Mind</i>, Corey Robin argues conservatives are definable by their obsession with upholding existing order/hierarchies. All conservative political ideas are secondary and mutable—in <i>reaction</i> to liberals’ goals—lacking adherence to a core set of beliefs. Robin’s definition of conservatism is a wide net that captures a diverse set of politicians and commentators with a surprisingly narrow mindset.<br/><blockquote>I use the words conservative, reactionary, counterrevolutionary interchangeably... I seat philosophers, statesmen, slaveholders, scribblers, Catholics, fascists, evangelicals, businessmen, racists, and hacks at the same table: Hobbes next to Hayek, Burke across from Palin, Nietzsche in between Ayn Rand and Antonin Scalia, with Adams, Calhoun, Oakeshott, Ronald Reagan, Tocqueville, Theodore Roosevelt, Margaret Thatcher, Ernst Jünger, Carl Schmitt, Winston Churchill, Phyllis Schlafly, Richard Nixon, Irving Kristin, Francis Fukuyama, and George W. bush interspersed throughout. </blockquote><br/><br/>I was a STEM major in university and, honestly, don’t know enough about each of Robin’s hundreds of conservative foils to critique each attack. But the reviews’ events and political issues are ones that all Americans can appreciate: 9/11 affecting support for foreign interventionism; use of torture; slaveholders justification and mourning for the loss of slaveholding. There were also essays on American history that I should’ve known but didn’t, like America’s support for the oppressive, undemocratic Guatemalan government and the Lavender scare (like the Red scare except it targeted gays and affected several times more people).<br/><br/>Robin dissecting conservatives’ views with primary sources alone is the most impressive part of <i>The Reactionary Mind</i>. Leftist revolutionaries are absent and, without them, Robin exposes conservatives’ sentiments on race, women, and war in a harsh light. Several epiphanies are unexpected; for example, conservatives’ natural leeriness towards Christianity and Capitalism. Christianity too literally starts to look like socialism (see: Rand and Nietzsche), and Capitalism too dominant begins to interfere with hegemony validating warfare (see: neocons like Bush and Rumsfeld).<br/><br/>I only wish that <i>The Reactionary Mind</i> had been written a decade later. In the books’ conclusion, Robin, too soon, wonders what liberal crusades conservatives have left to oppose: “With the exception of the gay rights movement, there are today no threatening social movements of the left.” He thinks that conservatism has “achieved its purpose” in defeating each of the left’s great social movements. Robin’s inability to predict Trump-world is a bit surprising given that he could’ve written the MAGA slogan himself in the first chapter, “Conservatism and Counterrevolution”.<br/><br/><blockquote>People on the left often fail to realize this, but conservatism really does speak to and for people who have lost something. It may be a landed estate or the privileges of white skin, the unquestioned authority of a husband or the untrammeled rights of a factory owner... The chief aim of the loser is not—and indeed cannot be—preservation or protection. It is recovery and restoration. That, I believe, is one of the secrets of conservatism’s success. For all it’s insistence upon triumph and will... conservatism can be an ultimately pedestrian affair.</blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,
44007362,"I, Claudius",Robert Graves,"Graves, Robert",,"=""""","=""""",5,4.21,RosettaBooks,Kindle Edition,436,2014,1934,2019/10/29,2019/10/12,,,read,"<i>I, Claudius</i> was the third book by Robert Graves and his first with commercial success. It’s an autobiography from the lost perspective of “Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus.” While Claudius the actual member of Roman royalty did write an actual 8-part autobiography, this is not that. Instead, it’s a humorous recollection of the trials and misfortunes of Rome in years of political turmoil as recorded by other historical sources (Gaius, Plutarch and Suetonius). Graves liberally connects the dots of those sources, providing fleshed out conversations between the emperors and all those around them.<br/><br/>Claudius himself was a physically challenged child of the sister of Augustus. While his family members are, one by one, eliminated by paranoid emperors, his stutter and bookishness prevent him from ever being seen as a threat. For example, his being the “butt” of jokes saves his life from Caligula who, meanwhile, mercilessly kills each of his sisters. <br/><br/>While I don’t enjoy the standard churn and burn of palace intrigue on TV, it’s consistently entertaining in <i>I, Claudius</i>. Macabre blends with absurdity. Each emperor — first Augustus then Tiberius then Caligula — feels less secure in their autocracy and resorts to worse measures to preserve it. And their means of preservation, while undoubtably terrifying for the actual Roman Senate, become comedic thanks to Graves’ framing and timing. For example, an assassin strangles Tiberius’ nephew because the nephew’s succession is a threat. The assassin then stuffs the deceased nephew’s throat with a peach-seed. A peach-tree near the nephew’s body is charged with murder in court, uprooted, and burned in retribution. In another example, an accuser of forgery against Claudius is caught lying; Caligula has the accusers’ hands cut off and tied around his neck as a simple “warning.”<br/><br/>The novel I kept thinking of while reading <i>I, Claudius</i> was <i>Catch-22</i>. Both feature powerful civilizations in the midst of war and use black comedy to skewer their respective bureaucracies.<br/><br/><i>I, Claudius</i> has affected me in two positive ways. The first is that it’s given me some context and interest in the Roman Empire that I lacked before. I was surprised to read Claudius’ Wikipedia page (pre-emperorship) and find little information that had failed to make it into Graves’ novel. I’m more likely to read about the time period preceding or following that covered in <i>I, Claudius</i>. The second way it affected me is in cementing my interest in historical fiction. I read <i>The Shogun</i> before this, but struggled to relate or empathize with its protagonist’s acclimation to a feudal Japan. Though Graves’ subject is even more distant in the past, his novel is more palatable for its quicker pacing and relentless black comedy.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Like other Culture series novels, it tracks the happenings of an advanced civilization, the Culture, as their hippy, drugged-out civilians attempt to maintain peace in a violent and chaotic universe.<br/><br/>But this is the least sci-fi of the sci-fi series. It really tracks the Sarl, a medievalesque humanoid species at war within a Shellworld: an artificial planet layers upon layers of ""floors"" comprise concentric worlds, each with their own sets of species at varying levels of technological development. The Sarl fight the Deldeyn, a species that's one level above them in the Shellworld but of equal technological development. That fight is watched by layers upon layers of more advanced civilizations, all the way up to the Culture. Within the Sarl leadership, there's betrayal and murder and scheming that opens into a saga of princes fighting, alternately, for survival and control.<br/><br/>Medieval conflict is interweaved by Anaplian, a Special Circumstances agent who left the Shellworld as a child. She was adopted by the Culture, receiving a golden ticket to a technological enlightenment. It’s from her view that Banks weaves in the most emphasis on power and foreign policy. The chapters ""Seed Drill"" and ""The Hundredth Idiot,"" in particular, are rich with debate on power and interventionism:<br/><br/>""Tell me you're ashamed."" ""We are,"" Anaplian assured him. ""Constantly. Still, we can prove that it works. The interfering and the dirty-tricking; it works. Salvation is in statistics.""<br/><br/>""One might intervene and interfere at every available opportunity and at every single instant when things did not turn out as any decent and reasonable creature would like. However, with every intervention, every interference--no matter how individually well-meant and seemingly right and proper and judged purely on its own immediate merits--one would, subtly, incrementally but most certainly remove all freedom and dignity from the very people one sought only to help.""<br/><br/>Despite the momentary debates like those above, I had a hard time getting through Matter. Kindle estimates the book should take 11 hours to read... but it took me a month and a half to finish. I felt no sympathy for either prince, and, for the majority of the book, the main characters were in three groups: Anaplian traveling to the Sarl, one prince traveling to meet Anaplian, and one prince fending off assassination attempts. That means two-thirds of the characters spent the majority of the book traveling to the others. Without twist, without action.<br/><br/>And I did not care about the Sarl royalty's backstabbing. Anaplian did nothing with her Special Circumstances superpowers, and the high-tech weaponry was isolated to the final chapter of the novel. Even the Minds' were largely absent, despite Anaplian spending the first 85% of the book traveling among ships. Banks went for a sprawling universe drenched in lore and intra and interspecies conflict for power. But instead, it coalesced into a muddled medieval slog.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

There must be a dozen places where Larson reminds us that Holmes was a blue-eyed, social chameleon who wooed his audiences and touched women on the arms inappropriately. I was bored after the first time.<br/><br/>While I appreciate Larson’s strict adherence to history, I don’t think he had enough material on Holmes. I would’ve preferred either less of him, with a level of detail only matching that of the insane assassin that kills Harrison, or a deeper dive into the life of an inept Chicago detective. I have to imagine that the police force’s inability to connect the clues around Holmes would have been more interesting than Holmes himself.<br/><br/>Finally, I strongly disliked Larson’s fixation with trivia. You know the copy-paste meme where an absurd anecdote is followed by “and that man’s name... Albert Einstein”? Larson does this repeatedly. I honestly wonder whether this book was the inspiration for the meme. “And that junior architects name... Frank Lloyd Wright.” “And that painters last name... Disney. And Disney’s son... Walt Disney.” I’m certain the intent was to stress the importance of the fair. It MATTERED, and it’s impact resonates TO THIS DAY. But the trivia is thrown between sections to which it’s otherwise irrelevant. It’s like Larson had sticky notes covered in factoids he couldn’t wait to share. But they should’ve been footnotes or consolidated to the suffix. Instead, each modern-day tie-in is as distracting as a commercial in the middle of a feature film.<br/><br/>I was impressed by Larson’s ability to breath life into a group of long dead architects, artists, engineers and politicians. I just wish he hadn’t tried to do the same with Holmes or his trivia.",true,,1,,,0,,,,,
23168817,"The Dark Forest (Remembrance of Earth’s Past, #2)",Liu Cixin,"Cixin, Liu",Joel Martinsen,"=""""","=""""",4,4.40,Tor Books,Hardcover,512,2015,2008,2019/08/30,2019/08/30,,,read,"The Goodreads hivemind is right, the second book is better.<br/><br/>Earth is in preparation mode, readying to meet the Trisolaran fleet 350 years in the future. Luo Ji, a could’ve been cosmic sociologist, is elected Wallfacer: a strategist tasked with outwitting the Trisolarians.<br/><br/>The book meanders for its first third. Three retired men talk politics. Luo imminent-domains a mansion and gets a mail-order bride. The “Wallbreakers” do nothing but take orders within the Three Body Problem.<br/><br/>But the slow windup is tolerable given the world’s pressure-cooker atmosphere. The issue’s scale matches global warming but includes a countdown to annihilation (each chapter starts with the current year within the ‘Crisis Age’). There’s mass confusion and pessimism. Factions of humans continue to debate welcoming the aliens, negotiating with them from space or continuing with plans for war.<br/><br/>The book takes a quantum leap when Luo hibernates smack dab in the middle of the book. He and Shi jump 200 years into the future, everyone from the first half dies, and Luo emerges into a completely different world and advanced work.<br/><br/>What this series does well is put human generations in perspective. Xiu paints a vivid picture of humans in a wave pool. The water behind the wave is the deceased ancestor, the water in front is the descendants not yet born. The action of the series follows the humans, alive, in the middle of the wave as it moves through time. At the end of the pool is a wall where the wave’s fate intersect with the Trisolarian fleet.<br/><br/>Where Three Body Problem tapped into something deep about scientific discovery and technological progress, Dark Forest drills into those tools’ application: species level survival. It’s the first axiom of Luo’s cosmic sociology and it underpins his solution to Fermi’s Paradox. Xiu imagines the universe as a “Dark Forest” filled with hunter-like civilizations stalking one another, killing each other silently, lest their position be revealed and they too be exterminated. It’s bleak and is revealed slowly at first — then epically at the book’s conclusion. <br/><br/>My small gripe is with the sophons that were in both this and The Three Body Problem. While they’re a great plot device for instantaneous communication and a halt on human technology, they confound Luo/Xiu’s solution to Fermi’s paradox. The Trisolar planet produced many sophons within a short time and shot them to Earth at the speed of light. If they’re so cheap and powerful, civilizations of the dark forest could monitor virtually every Earth-like planet in their vicinity, and Luo’s destruction “spell” would not have worked as easily as it did on his targeted star.",true,,1,,,0,,,,,
20518872,The Three-Body Problem (Remembrance of Earth’s Past #1),Liu Cixin,"Cixin, Liu",Ken Liu,"=""0765377063""","=""9780765377067""",4,4.06,Tor Books,Hardcover,399,2014,2006,2019/08/19,2019/08/19,,,read,"About half way through I thought that The Three-Body Problem was going to affect me the way Dune did. It fell short, but not by much.<br/><br/>The pace is relentless. The characters, timelines and format (first person, government documents, interviews) weave in and out. Just when you’re tired of Professor Wang’s ghostly countdown, the book pivots and he’s in a totally different, virtual, and more incoherent world than the one he left. Once you’re tired of Wang it switches to Xe and visa versa.<br/><br/>And there were mysteries that, revealed, I was disappointed to have not foreseen. The orbital mechanics of The Three-Body video game, the source of Wang’s countdown, and Xe being the “Commander” that first contacted the aliens. <br/><br/>The Three-Body virtual reality game is the book’s real highlight. It’s both disorienting and thrilling. The game’s opaque objective — to predict the sunrise and sunset — is repeatedly interrupted by annihilation. The NPCs’ efforts to predict the weather are melancholic; each scientist, in real-life, truly spent the energy of their life trying to understand nature. And the man-made universe asks both player and NPC: “What’s the point? Disaster will strike you too.”<br/><br/>I liked the historical backdrop, the science-worship and the humans conspiring with the Trisolaris. The international political cooperation and the infighting among the Trisolaris-sympathizers all felt plausible and will bring me back for the second book in the series.<br/><br/>But there were bits of conversation that nearly sank this book. See: anything spoken by the police office during a Command Center meeting. See: dozens of conversations like the ones where Wang says “but... how?” and the theoretical physicist flies into a 2-page explanation of the 7th dimension or the invariant nature of physics. I still give the book four-stars, but it’s because I’m assuming these conversations and events made more sense in the Chinese version. <br/><br/>Finally, I hope the second book avoids the plot-movers that it resorted to at the book’s end. The literal shooting of a nuclear bomb with a gun. The slicing of the Judgement Day ship via nanomaterial-rope (was that the climax?). Plus, why did the Trisolaris-sympathizers get a four-decades long third person overview of Trisolaris? Why would Trisolaris type that out, from that perspective... with a detailed account of The Listener?<br/><br/>Despite my misgivings with the end, I’m hopeful for and have already ordered the second of the trilogy. There were enough heady sections between the historical flashbacks and virtual reality to get me hooked.",true,,1,,,0,,,,,

This book is enjoyable to read. In it, Junger convincingly argues that, counterintuitively, social cohesion is a positive outcome of war and that this confers positive mental health benefits on those affected. Personally, I found the most vivid parts of the book to be those concerning the bombings of London during World War II and his own experiences with PTSD in New York City's subway. And politically I agree with his plan for how best to accommodate soldiers returning from war: job placement and education. He argues that platitudes like ""thank you for your service"" only amplify the social disconnect between soldiers and civilians.<br/><br/>I did not enjoy the books lack of in-text citations and footnotes. He explains in the preface why he excluded them, arguing that they are distracting. And there is an appendix. But Junger presents many sweeping sociologic and psychological arguments that seem shaky without research. Junger's style in <i>Tribe</i> is the polar opposite of Sapulsky's in <i>Behave</i> where each minor assertion on human behavior is reinforced with half pages of footnotes on studies and reviews and exposition on the conflicts raging in academia. While Junger is not a psychologist or neurobiologist by training, I believe that he could have done something similar. The sacrifice to readibility would have been worth the added believability.<br/><br/>I recommend the book but am not convinced. Hopefully <i>Tribe</i> prompts more research.",true,,1,,,0,,,,,
