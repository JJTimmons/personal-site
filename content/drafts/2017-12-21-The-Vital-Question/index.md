### 5. Origin of Complex Cells

A quote by Orson Welles (alluding to prokaryotic vs eukaryotic structural complexity):

> In Italy, for thirty years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, they had five hundred years of democracy and peace -- and what did they produce? The cuckoo clock

Lane asks why eukaryotes are more structurally complex than prokaryotes:

>In the broadest of terms, prokaryotes explored the possibilities of metabolism, finding ingenious solutions to the most arcane chemical challenges, while eukaryotes turned their back on this chemical cleverness, and explored instead the untapped potential of larger size and greater structural complexity.

There is no intermediate between the two, he points out, suggesting that a single large event makes the most sense. There must be a single common ancestor, he suggests, because three-quarters of eukaryotic genes have a prokaryotic equivalent (with the remaining one-quarter being from archae). This suggests a chimeric origin, where a bacteria and a archae merged to form the population that quickly led to the structurally complex eukaryotes of today.

>This is the simplest possible scenario for the origin of eukaryotes: there was a single chimeric event between an archaeal host cell and a bacterial endosymbiont... I favor this argument on the basis of Occam's razor alone.

Lane then suggests that the chemiosmotic coupling explains structural diversity in eukaryotes with use of a metric: energy per gene. Cells spend 80% of their energy budget on protein synthesis. Proteins are expensive to produce: each peptide bond requires at least 5 ATP for form (as compared to a single ATP needed in DNA). This makes total protein energy consumption linear with protein production.

The problem of surface area to volume ratio is an issue for prokaryotes, since their chemiosmosis is restricted to their surface, which doesn't keep up with the growth in surface area.
