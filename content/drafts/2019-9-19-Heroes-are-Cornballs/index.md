JPEGMAFIA's _Veteran_ is the rap album I listened to most this last year. Its replay value comes from intense sounds unlike anything I've heard before. On "Real Nega" Peggy comes in over an Ol' Dirty Bastard's guttural "aaaaAAAAHHH" sample tuned to the song's beat; a beat that then gets hammered over with bass drums. On "Libtard Anthem" the background percussion sounds like a baseball card hitting the spokes of a bicycle's wheel while JPEGMAFIA drones asinine insults like:

> "Word on the street, you say yee-haw.
> Word on the street, yougot 'preme on...
> Word on the street, you're Bill Maher.
> Word on the street, I know my real mom."

Above all, _Veteran_ is aggressive. The album, titled for Peggy's own military service, is consistently abrasive. He throws shade at Trump, haters, and liberals alike: "You're the one that got that liberal arts degree." And the hate is unflinching. One banger is called "I Cannot Fucking Wait Until Morrissey Dies" (lead singer of the Smiths). Peggy reiterates the threat on "Rock N Roll is Dead": "Put hands on a blogger, make him beg for his life."

So listening to _All My Heroes Are Cornballs_ was no small surprise.
